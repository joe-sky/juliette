## Description

Juliette is a reactive state management library inspired by [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/).
It reduces Redux boilerplate, eliminates reducer's conditional branching, simplifies
the configuration and introduces NgRx architecture into the framework-agnostic world.
Juliette is a TypeScript friendly library and can be used in Angular, React or any JavaScript application.

### Reduced Boilerplate Without Reducer's Ifology

Juliette reduces Redux boilerplate by merging action and reducer into one component called handler.
To better understand the benefits of handler, let's first look at how actions and reducers are defined by using NgRx.

<details>
  <summary><b>Old NgRx Approach</b></summary>

```typescript
// users.actions.ts

export const FETCH_USERS = '[Users] Fetch Users';
export const FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS = '[Users] Fetch Users Success';
export const FETCH_USERS_ERROR = '[Users] Fetch Users Error';

export class FetchUsers implements Action {
  readonly type = FETCH_USERS;
}

export class FetchUsersSuccess implements Action {
  readonly type = FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS;

  constructor(public payload: User[]) {}
}

export class FetchUsersError implements Action {
  readonly type = FETCH_USERS_ERROR;
}

export type Action = FetchUsers | FetchUsersSuccess | FetchUsersError;

// users.reducer.ts

import * as UsersActions from './users.actions';

export interface State {
  users: User[];
  showLoading: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  users: [],
  showLoading: false,
};

export function reducer(state = initialState, action: UsersActions.Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case UsersActions.FETCH_USERS:
      return { ...state, showLoading: true };
    case UsersActions.FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, users: action.payload, showLoading: false };
    case UsersActions.FETCH_USERS_ERROR:
      return { ...state, users: [], showLoading: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
</details>

TypeScript code above shows the old NgRx syntax and it is pretty similar to traditional Redux approach.
As you can see, it's too much code for three simple actions. Then, NgRx team introduced a new way
to define actions and reducers.

<details>
  <summary><b>New NgRx Approach</b></summary>
  
```typescript
// users.actions.ts

export const fetchUsers = createAction('[Users] Fetch Users');
export const fetchUsersSuccess = createAction(
  '[Users] Fetch Users Success',
  props<{ users: User[] }>(),
);
export const fetchUsersError = createAction('[Users] Fetch Users Error');

// users.reducer.ts

import * as UsersActions from './users.actions';

export interface State {
  users: User[];
  showLoading: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  users: [],
  showLoading: false,
};

export const reducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(UsersActions.fetchUsers, state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true })),
  on(UsersActions.fetchUsersSuccess, (state, { users }) => ({
    ...state,
    users,
    showLoading: false,
  })),
  on(UsersActions.fetchUsersError, state => ({
    ...state,
    users: [],
    showLoading: false,
  })),
);
````
</details>

With new NgRx syntax, less amount of code is needed to define actions and reducer. Conditional
branching for actions in the reducer is masked by the `on` operator, but it is still present.
Let's now look at how the same example is implemented using Juliette handlers.

<details>
  <summary><b>Juliette Approach</b></summary>

```typescript
// users.handlers.ts

export const stateKey = 'users';

export interface State {
  users: User[];
  showLoading: boolean;
}

export const initialState: State = {
  users: [],
  showLoading: false,
};

export const fetchUsers = createHandler<State>(
  '[Users] Fetch Users',
  stateKey,
  state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true }),
);
export const fetchUsersSuccess = createHandler<State, { users: User[] }>(
  '[Users] Fetch Users Success',
  stateKey,
  (state, { users }) => ({ ...state, users, showLoading: false }),
);
export const fetchUsersError = createHandler<State>(
  '[Users] Fetch Users Error',
  stateKey,
  state => ({ ...state, users: [], showLoading: false }),
);
````
</details>

As you can see, Juliette way is declarative. Also, the least amount of code is required to define the same logic.
Instead of creating actions and then adding new conditional branches to the reducer, Juliette's handler creator accepts
the reducer function on-site.

### Simplified Configuration

You don't need to register reducers to the store anymore!

### Framework Agnostic

Core features of Juliette are implemented in pure TypeScript. The library is small sized and has RxJS as the only production dependency.
All framework specific stuff is in separate libraries. There are two plugin libraries available, for Angular and for React. They provide core
functionalities adapted to the framework design. Of course, Juliette can be used in Angular or React without plugins, but that way wouldn't
be native.

## Architecture

Juliette doesn't have a much less complex execution flow than NgRx, but one part of the architecture is different.
Merging action and reducer into the handler will reduce the boilerplate and will not make a mess in complex systems.
Let's look at the diagram.

![Juliette Architecture](https://i.ibb.co/nBK3Wk3/juliette-architecture.png)

When an event occurs on the view, it will dispatch the handler. Then, if the handler has a reducer function, it will be executed by the store
and new state will be reflected in the view. After that, if the handler has a side effect, that effect will be performed. Lastly, if the effect
returns a new handler, the execution process will be repeated.
 
## Installation

Run `npm install --save juliette` to install core Juliette library.

If you are using Angular, install additional package by running `npm install --save juliette-ng` command.

If you are using React, install additional package by running `npm install --save juliette-react` command.

## Guide

### Handlers

As already mentioned, handler is the component that merges the action and the reducer. You can create Juliette's handler by using `createHandler` function.
This function has two required arguments `type` and `stateKey`. `type` is similar to action type in Redux and it needs to be unique on application
level. `stateKey` is a property name in application state of state chunk that defined handler refers to. Let's see `createHandler` in action.

```typescript
const showCreateTodoDialog = createHandler('[Todos] Show Create Todo Dialog', 'todos'); 
````

Third argument of `createHandler` is a reducer function and it's optional. You can pass it when state needs to be updated on handler dispatch.

```typescript
const fetchTodos = createHandler('[Todos] Fetch Todos', 'todos', state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true }));
````

If you try compile the code above, you'll get compilation error. That's because `createHandler` function is strongly typed in order to avoid mistakes. You
need to pass type of todos state chunk as generic argument.

```typescript
const fetchTodos = createHandler<TodosState>('[Todos] Fetch Todos', 'todos', state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true }));
````

`createHandler` function has two signatures. First is when defined handler doesn't have payload, and second is when it has. Payload type needs to be
passed as second generic argument in order to prevent passing wrong payload to the defined handler on dispatch.
Reducer function is optional argument in second signature too.

```typescript
const createTodo = createHandler<TodosState, { todo: Todo }>('[Todos] Create Todo', 'todos');

const updateTodosCurrentPage = createHandler<TodosState, { currentPage: number }>(
  '[Todos] Update Todos Current Page',
  'todos',
  (state, { currentPage }) => ({ ...state, currentPage }),
);
```` 

### Store

To create the store, Juliette provides `createStore` function. It accepts initial application state as an argument. Second argument is `debugMode`
and it's optional. You can enable `debugMode` when application is in development mode in order to log the state and handlers on every dispatch.

```typescript
const store = createStore(initialAppState, isDevMode);
````

To dispatch handlers, store provides `dispatch` function.

```typescript
store.dispatch(TodosHandlers.fetchTodos());
````

There are two ways to get the application state. In both cases, you'll get the state as an observable.
First is to get the whole state by using `state$` property from the store.

```typescript
const appState$ = store.state$;
````

Second option is to select partial state that you need for current view. For that purpose, Juliette's store provides `select` function.
You can pass the name of state chunk that you need or selector function that accepts state as an argument and returns selected stuff.

```typescript
const todosState1$ = store.select('todos');
const todosState2$ = store.select(state => state.todos);
````

Another way to select state from the store is to use regular RxJS operators.

```typescript
const todosState3$ = store.state$.pipe(pluck('todos'));
const todosState4$ = store.state$.pipe(map(state => state.todos));
````
