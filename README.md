## Overview

Juliette is a reactive state management library inspired by [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/).
It reduces Redux boilerplate, eliminates reducer's conditional branching, simplifies
the configuration and introduces NgRx architecture into the framework-agnostic world.
Juliette is a TypeScript friendly library and can be used in Angular, React or any JavaScript application.

### Reduced Boilerplate Without Conditional Branching

Juliette reduces Redux boilerplate by merging the action and the reducer into one component called handler.
To better understand the benefits of the handler, let's first look at how actions and reducers are defined by using NgRx.

<details>
  <summary><b>Old NgRx Approach</b></summary>

```typescript
// users.actions.ts

export const FETCH_USERS = '[Users] Fetch Users';
export const FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS = '[Users] Fetch Users Success';
export const FETCH_USERS_ERROR = '[Users] Fetch Users Error';

export class FetchUsers implements Action {
  readonly type = FETCH_USERS;
}

export class FetchUsersSuccess implements Action {
  readonly type = FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS;

  constructor(public payload: User[]) {}
}

export class FetchUsersError implements Action {
  readonly type = FETCH_USERS_ERROR;
}

export type Action = FetchUsers | FetchUsersSuccess | FetchUsersError;

// users.reducer.ts

import * as UsersActions from './users.actions';

export interface State {
  users: User[];
  showLoading: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  users: [],
  showLoading: false,
};

export function reducer(state = initialState, action: UsersActions.Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case UsersActions.FETCH_USERS:
      return { ...state, showLoading: true };
    case UsersActions.FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, users: action.payload, showLoading: false };
    case UsersActions.FETCH_USERS_ERROR:
      return { ...state, users: [], showLoading: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
</details>

TypeScript code above shows the old NgRx syntax and it is pretty similar to the traditional Redux approach.
As you can see, it's too much code for three simple actions. Then, NgRx team introduced a new way
to define actions and reducers.

<details>
  <summary><b>New NgRx Approach</b></summary>

```typescript
// users.actions.ts

export const fetchUsers = createAction('[Users] Fetch Users');
export const fetchUsersSuccess = createAction(
  '[Users] Fetch Users Success',
  props<{ users: User[] }>(),
);
export const fetchUsersError = createAction('[Users] Fetch Users Error');

// users.reducer.ts

import * as UsersActions from './users.actions';

export interface State {
  users: User[];
  showLoading: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  users: [],
  showLoading: false,
};

export const reducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(UsersActions.fetchUsers, state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true })),
  on(UsersActions.fetchUsersSuccess, (state, { users }) => ({
    ...state,
    users,
    showLoading: false,
  })),
  on(UsersActions.fetchUsersError, state => ({
    ...state,
    users: [],
    showLoading: false,
  })),
);
```
</details>

With new NgRx syntax, less amount of code is needed to define actions and reducers. Conditional
branching for actions in the reducer is masked by the `on` operator, but it is still present.
Let's now look at how the same example is implemented using Juliette handlers.

<details>
  <summary><b>Juliette Approach</b></summary>

```typescript
// users.handlers.ts

export const featureKey = 'users';

export interface State {
  users: User[];
  showLoading: boolean;
}

export const initialState: State = {
  users: [],
  showLoading: false,
};

export const fetchUsers = createHandler<State>(
  '[Users] Fetch Users',
  featureKey,
  state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true }),
);
export const fetchUsersSuccess = createHandler<State, { users: User[] }>(
  '[Users] Fetch Users Success',
  featureKey,
  (state, { users }) => ({ ...state, users, showLoading: false }),
);
export const fetchUsersError = createHandler<State>(
  '[Users] Fetch Users Error',
  featureKey,
  state => ({ ...state, users: [], showLoading: false }),
);
```
</details>

As you can see, Juliette way is declarative. Also, the least amount of code is required to define the same logic.
Instead of creating actions and then adding new conditional branches to the reducer, Juliette's handler creator accepts
the reducer function on-site.

### Simplified Configuration

You don't need to register reducers to the store anymore!

### Framework Agnostic

Core features of Juliette are implemented in pure TypeScript. The library is small sized and has RxJS as the only production dependency.
All framework specific stuff is in separate libraries. There are two plugin libraries available, for Angular and for React. They provide core
functionalities adapted to the framework design. Of course, Juliette can be used in Angular or React without plugins, but that way wouldn't
be native.

## Architecture

Juliette doesn't have a much less complex execution flow than NgRx, but one part of the architecture is different.
Merging action and reducer into the handler will reduce the boilerplate and will not make a mess in complex systems.
Let's look at the diagram.

![Juliette Architecture](https://i.ibb.co/nBK3Wk3/juliette-architecture.png)

When an event occurs on the view, it will dispatch the handler. Then, if the handler has a reducer function, it will be executed by the store
and new state will be reflected in the view. After that, if the handler has a side effect, that effect will be performed. Lastly, if the effect
returns a new handler, the execution process will be repeated.

## Installation

Run `npm install --save juliette` to install core Juliette library.

If you are using Angular, install additional package by running `npm install --save juliette-ng` command.

If you are using React, install additional package by running `npm install --save juliette-react` command.

## Guide

### Handlers

As already mentioned, handler is the component that merges the action and the reducer. You can create the handler by using `createHandler`
function and there are four different ways to do this. Let's look at the simplest first.

```typescript
const showCreateTodoDialog = createHandler('[Todos] Show Create Todo Dialog'); 
```

`createHandler` requires only `type` as an argument. `type` is similar to Redux action type and must be unique at the application
level. Another case is when handler requires a payload whose type must be passed as a generic argument.

```typescript
const createTodo = createHandler<{ todo: Todo }>('[Todos] Create Todo');
```

The third case is when the handler needs state changes. Then, you need to pass `featureKey` as a second argument. `featureKey` is the key of the state piece
from the application state to which the defined handler refers. The third argument is a function that accepts the old state and returns a new state, similar
to the reducer from Redux.

```typescript
const fetchTodos = createHandler(
  '[Todos] Fetch Todos',
  todosFeatureKey,
  state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true }),
);
```

If you try compile the code above, you will get a compilation error. That is because `createHandler` function is strongly typed in order to avoid
potential mistakes. To fix the error, you need to pass the type of todos state as a generic argument.

```typescript
const fetchTodos = createHandler<TodosState>(
  '[Todos] Fetch Todos',
  todosFeatureKey,
  state => ({ ...state, showLoading: true }),
);
```

The last case is when handler needs both, the payload and the reducer. Let's see it in action.

```typescript
const fetchTodosSuccess = createHandler<TodosState, { todos: Todo[] }>(
  '[Todos] Fetch Todos Success',
  todosFeatureKey,
  (state, { todos }) => ({ ...state, todos }),
);
```

### Store

To create the store, Juliette provides `createStore` function. It accepts the initial application state as the first argument.
The second argument is `debugMode` and it's optional. You can enable debug mode when the application is in development mode
in order to log the state and handlers on every dispatch.

```typescript
const store = createStore(initialAppState, true);
```

To dispatch handlers, the store provides `dispatch` function.

```typescript
store.dispatch(fromTodos.fetchTodos());
```

There are two ways to get the application state. In both cases, you will get the state as an observable. First way is to get the entire
state by using `state$` property from the store.

```typescript
const appState$ = store.state$;
```

Second option is to select a partial state. For this purpose, Juliette store provides `select` function. You can pass the key of the state
piece that you need or a selector function that accepts the state as an argument and returns the selected chunk.

```typescript
const todosState1$ = store.select('todos');
const todosState2$ = store.select(state => state.todos);
```

Another way to select a state is to use regular RxJS operators.

```typescript
const todosState3$ = store.state$.pipe(pluck('todos'));
const todosState4$ = store.state$.pipe(map(state => state.todos));
```

### Effects

If you need to perform a side effect when some handler is dispatched, Juliette effect is the right place to do that. This approach of handling
side effects is introduced by NgRx team and it's more reactive and declarative than using Redux middlewares. Enough theory, let's move to the
examples. To create a effect, Juliette provides `createEffect` function. It accepts an observable that returns new handler or nothing.

```typescript
const createTodo$
```

TODO write docs for:
- effect for single handler (access to the payload, access to the store, return new handler, without return)
- return multiple handlers from effect
- effect for multiple handlers (updateCurrentPage, updateSearch -> fetch)
